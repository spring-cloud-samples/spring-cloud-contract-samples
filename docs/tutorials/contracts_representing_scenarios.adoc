= Contracts Representing Scenarios (Stateful Stubs) {version}

In this tutorial. we keep the contracts together with the producer code. In the
contracts, we describe a stateful scenario where the stub needs to have "memory" to know
what the previous state was and what the next one should be.

== Scenarios

== Tutorial

Using Consumer Driven Contracts is like using TDD at the architecture level. We start by
writing a test on the consumer side.
=== Consumer flow 1

image::{images_folder}/consumer_flow_1.png[title="Interact with cloned producer code"]

==== IDE setup

In your IDE, open the `consumer` project (through either Maven or Gradle).

In this scenario we need to write a test for HTTP communication that meets the following
criteria:

* The consumer gets asked about the current and previous state of intoxication of a given
person.
* The more you drink, the more intoxicated you get.
* The flow of intoxication states goes `SOBER` -> `TIPSY` -> `DRUNK` -> `WASTED`.
* The consumer asks the producer for a beer for a given person and, in return the
information about the state of intoxication is sent back

In the standard CDC process, we would do TDD. However, in this case, you already have
some code ready. The test `IntoxicationControllerTest` contains tests of our feature.
In the `IntoxicationController`, we need to call an endpoint on the producer side.

Let's first write our missing test. There's already a method called
`sendARequestAndExpectStatuses` created for us to fill out. We want to use `MockMvc` to
send a request to the `/wasted` endpoint with the name `marcin` in the JSON request body.
As a response, we expect to get the `previousStatus` and `currentStatus` of intoxication.

[source,java]
----
include::{consumer}/src/test/java/com/example/intoxication/IntoxicationControllerTest.java[tags=test]
----

If we run this test, it fails because we did not write an implementation in the
`IntoxicationController`. We want to write the implementation, but we do not yet know the
structure of the request. Since we do not yet know how the API should look, we can clone
the producer's code to experiment with its API.

include::snippets/setup_cloned_producer.adoc[]

==== Defining Stateful HTTP Contracts

In the clone of the producer's code, let's create a folder called
`src/test/resources/contracts/beer/intoxication`. In Spring Cloud Contract, you can
define steps for a given scenario by relying on the naming convention of the files: If
your contract file starts with a number and a `_` character, it is assumed to be part of
the scenario. Here are three examples: `1_sober.groovy`, `2_tipsy.groovy`, and
`3_drunk.groovy`.

Let's create those three files and start writing our first scenario. Open the
`1_sober.groovy` file. We need to start by calling the
`org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make` method.

[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {

}
----

Now let's provide a meaningful description by using the `description` method, as shown in
the following code:

[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
    Represents first step of getting fully drunk

    given:
        you didn't drink anything
    when:
        you get a beer
    then:
        you'll be tipsy
    """)
}
----

Next we can define the `request` part of the contract, as shown in the following code:

[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
    Represents first step of getting fully drunk

    given:
        you didn't drink anything
    when:
        you get a beer
    then:
        you'll be tipsy
    """)
    request {

    }
}
----

Let's assume that we want to send a `POST` request to to the `/beer` endpoint. To do so,
we might use the following code:

[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
    Represents first step of getting fully drunk

    given:
        you didn't drink anything
    when:
        you get a beer
    then:
        you'll be tipsy
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/beer"
    }
}
----

The body should contain a `name` field equal to `marcin`. We can use the Groovy map
notation to define it, as shown in the following code:

[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
    Represents first step of getting fully drunk

    given:
        you didn't drink anything
    when:
        you get a beer
    then:
        you'll be tipsy
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/beer"
        body(name: "marcin")
    }
}
----

The content type should be `application/json`. The following code shows how to set it:

[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
    Represents first step of getting fully drunk

    given:
        you didn't drink anything
    when:
        you get a beer
    then:
        you'll be tipsy
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/beer"
        body(name: "marcin")
        headers {
            contentType(applicationJson())
        }
    }
}
----

Congratulations! You successfully defined the request side of the contract. Let's now
proceed with the response side, by defining the `response` block:

[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
    Represents first step of getting fully drunk

    given:
        you didn't drink anything
    when:
        you get a beer
    then:
        you'll be tipsy
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/beer"
        body(name: "marcin")
        headers {
            contentType(applicationJson())
        }
    }
    response {

    }
}
----

We want the response to return status `200`, which we can do with the following code:

[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
    Represents first step of getting fully drunk

    given:
        you didn't drink anything
    when:
        you get a beer
    then:
        you'll be tipsy
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/beer"
        body(name: "marcin")
        headers {
            contentType(applicationJson())
        }
    }
    response {
        status 200
    }
}
----

The response body should return a value of `SOBER` in the the `previousStatus` field and
a value of `TIPSY` in the the `currentStatus` field. The following code shows how we
might do it:

[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
    Represents first step of getting fully drunk

    given:
        you didn't drink anything
    when:
        you get a beer
    then:
        you'll be tipsy
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/beer"
        body(name: "marcin")
        headers {
            contentType(applicationJson())
        }
    }
    response {
        status 200
        body(
            previousStatus: "SOBER",
            currentStatus: "TIPSY"
        )
    }
}
----
Finally, the response headers should contain a content type of `application/json`, as
shown in the following code:

[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
Represents first step of getting fully drunk

given:
    you didn't drink anything
when:
    you get a beer
then:
    you'll be tipsy
""")
    request {
        method 'POST'
        url '/beer'
        body(
                name: "marcin"
        )
        headers {
            contentType(applicationJson())
        }
    }
    response {
        status 200
        body(
            previousStatus: "SOBER",
            currentStatus: "TIPSY"
        )
        headers {
            contentType(applicationJson())
        }
    }
}

----

Congratulations! You have successfully created your first contract!

Now we need to define the next two contracts: `2_tipsy.groovy` and `3_drunk.groovy`. You
can examine the <<_scenario_contracts,solution>>. The first transition will be from
`TIPSY` -> `DRUNK`. The last transition will be from `DRUNK` -> `WASTED`.

We have managed to define all the scenarios. Now we would like to generate the stubs so
that we can reuse them on the consumer side. To that end, we must set up the Spring Cloud
Contract plugin in the cloned repository, as shown in the following code:

include::snippets/setting_plugin_on_clone.adoc[]

If you check out the `1_sober.json` intoxication stub, you can see the following section:

[source,json]
----
"scenarioName" : "Scenario_intoxication",
"requiredScenarioState" : "Started",
"newScenarioState" : "Step1"
----

In this section, WireMock is told that:
* The name of the scenario is `Scenario_intoxication`. The name comes from the folder in
which the contracts were placed.
* The required scenario state is `Started`. That's the initial state.
* The next step is `Step1`. Every subsequent step will be called `Step` with appropriate
number appended.

If you check out `2_tipsy.json`, you can see that the required values of the previous and
next states got updated:

[source,json]
----
"scenarioName" : "Scenario_intoxication",
"requiredScenarioState" : "Step1",
"newScenarioState" : "Step2"
----

We have managed to install the stubs locally. it's time to move back to our consumer
test. Let's open the `IntoxicationController` class and write the missing implementation.
You can try to write it yourself or check out the <<_intoxication_controller,solution>>.

==== Turning on Stub Runner in HTTP Consumer Tests

After writing the implementation, if we rerun the tests, we get a connection refused
exception. That happens because we have yet to start the HTTP server with the stubs, as
we do in the following snippet:

include::snippets/stub_runner_http_consumer_tests.adoc[]

Congratulations! You have successfully created the contracts, defined the API that suits
your needs, and written the consumer part of the functionality! Now it's time to create a
pull request with the contract proposal and file it to the producer side.

=== Producer Flow 1

image::{images_folder}/producer_flow_1.png[title="Producer takes over the PR, writes missing impl and merges the PR"]

include::snippets/producer_flow.adoc[]

IMPORTANT: We were setting the plugin in the following since most likely you use the same
`producer` codebase as you have for previous tutorials. That is why we want the other
tests to still pass. If that's not the case (if you have only just started with this
particular tutorial) then you can remove the `packageWithBaseClasses` entry.

* The intoxication base class lays under the `intoxication` folder. Let's use the
`baseClassMappings` to set point the plugin to proper base classes, as shown in the
following snippet (for both Maven and Gradle):

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${spring-cloud-contract.version}</version>
    <extensions>true</extensions>
    <configuration>
        <packageWithBaseClasses>com.example</packageWithBaseClasses>
        <baseClassMappings>
            <baseClassMapping>
                <contractPackageRegex>.*intoxication.*</contractPackageRegex>
                <baseClassFQN>com.example.intoxication.BeerIntoxicationBase</baseClassFQN>
            </baseClassMapping>
        </baseClassMappings>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
contracts {
	packageWithBaseClasses = 'com.example'
	baseClassMappings {
		baseClassMapping(".*intoxication.*", "com.example.intoxication.BeerIntoxicationBase")
	}
}
----

==== Generating Tests from Contracts

Let's generate the tests! To do so, use the following code (for both Maven and Gradle):

[source,bash,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
$ ./mvnw clean install
----
+
[source,bash,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
$ ./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal
----

Consider a situation in which, suddenly, some tests start failing. Those tests are the
autogenerated tests created by Spring Cloud Contract. The tests can be found under
`/generated-test-sources/contracts/org/springframework/cloud/contract/verifier/tests/beer`,
in the `target` directory for Maven and in the `build` directory for Gradle. There is a
test for each folder in which you store your contracts. The name of the test
class is the name of that folder. Each of the contracts is a single test inside that test
class. If you check out the generated `IntoxicationTest`, you can seee that it got
annotated with `@FixMethodOrder(MethodSorters.NAME_ASCENDING)` in order to ensure
that the tests are executed sequentially.

Now we can fix the broken tests by providing the missing implementation.

==== Fixing Broken HTTP Tests

Let's start with HTTP. First, let's write the missing implementation in
`BeerServingController`. The logic to be written is simple: The
`responseProvider.thereYouGo(...)` returns the `Response`. The implementation is
basically a one liner, as shown in the following code snippet:

[source,java]
----
return this.responseProvider.thereYouGo(customer);
----

Let's fix the `BeerIntoxicationBase` class now. The idea of CDC is *NOT TO TEST* every
single feature. Contract tests are there to see if the API is matched, *NOT* to test that
the feature is working. That's why we shouldn't be accessing databases and taking similar
actions. That means that we can work with a fake instance of the `ResponseProvider`.

Let's start by writing the missing implementation of the `MockResponseProvider`
(<<_beerintoxicationbase,Show solution>>). You need to:
* ensure that the `name` is equal to `marcin`
* depending on the `current` state you'll need to set the `previous` and
`current` one and create the `Response`.

We need to maintain state between the tests. If you try to store the state in a field in
a base class, you lose it between test executions, because JUnit is reinitializing all
the fields. We can fix that by setting up a small Spring Context to be reused. The
following example shows what that annotation might look like:
+
[source,java]
----
@SpringBootTest(classes = BeerIntoxicationBase.Config.class)
----

We want RestAssured and MockMvc to reuse the web context that we have in our test. That's
why we need to set it up by using the following notation:

[source,java]
----
    @Autowired WebApplicationContext webApplicationContext;

    @Before
    public void setup() {
        RestAssuredMockMvc.webAppContextSetup(webApplicationContext);
    }
----

Now, when try re-running the build to regenerate the tests, the tests should pass. You
could now merge the pull request to master, and your CI system would build a fat jar and
the stubs.

Congratulations! You have completed the producer side of this tutorial!
