= Contracts in an external repository {version}

In this tutorial, we keep the contracts in a separate repository (a common arrangement).

include::../scenarios.adoc[]

== Flow

image::{images_folder}/flow.png[title="Consumer Driven Contract flow"]

== Tutorial

Using Consumer Driven Contracts is like using TDD at the architecture level. Let's start
by writing a test on the consumer side.

=== Consumer flow 1

image::{images_folder}/external_consumer_flow_1.png[title="Interact with cloned repo with contracts"]

IMPORTANT: For the sake of this tutorial, our consumer application is called
`beer-api-consumer`.

==== IDE setup

include::snippets/consumer_ide_setup.adoc[]

==== Cloning the repo with contracts

In this tutorial, we will not clone the repo with contracts. We'll open it in the IDE.
The repository is called `beer_contracts`.

==== Adding dependencies in the repo with contracts

Since we want the IDE to help us with code completion, let's add the necessary Spring
Cloud Contract dependencies to the `pom.xml` under `beer_contracts` repo. You need to
add `spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier` as a dependency, as shown in the following
example:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

IMPORTANT: Notice that we add the dependency in the `compile` scope, because we want all
of the contracts to be packaged as if they were production code. This task is performed
only once. When you add subsequent contracts, you won't be able to add them again.

==== Creating the proper folder structure

In order to use a repository with contracts, you need to set up the folders so that they
adhere to the following convention:
** `/slash/separated/group/id/of/producer/producer-artifactid/consumer-name/`
In this tutorial, our producer has the following coordinates:
`com.example:beer-api-producer-external`. Our consumer will be called
`beer-api-consumer`.

Create the contract directory by running the following commands at the command line:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd beer_contracts
$ mkdir -p src/main/resources/contracts/com/example/beer-api-producer-external/beer-api-consumer/messaging
$ mkdir -p src/main/resources/contracts/com/example/beer-api-producer-external/beer-api-consumer/rest
----
We have successfully created the proper folder structure. Time to add some contracts

==== Defining first HTTP contract

Let's move to the
`src/main/resources/contracts/com/example/beer-api-producer-external/beer-api-consumer/`
folder. (<<_proposal_of_simple_contracts_by_consumer,Show solution>>).

include::snippets/first_http_contract.adoc[]

==== Defining the Second HTTP Contract

Now it's time for you to create the second contract. Under
`src/main/resources/contracts/com/example/beer-api-producer-external/beer-api-consumer/rest`,
create a file called `shouldRejectABeerIfTooYoung.groovy`.
If you get lost, examine the <<_proposal_of_simple_contracts_by_consumer,solution>>. To
create the second contract:

. Set the `age` in the request to `17`.
. Update the response body to return a `status` of `NOT_OK`.
. Update the description.

==== Defining the First Messaging Contract

We've done the case for HTTP. Let's move to the
`src/main/resources/contracts/com/example/beer-api-producer-external/beer-api-consumer/messaging`
folder.

include::snippets/first_messaging_contract.adoc[]

Congratulations! You have created your first messaging contract!

==== Defining second messaging contract

Now it's time for you to create the second contract. Create a file called
`shouldSendRejectedVerification.groovy`.
If you get lost, examine the <<_proposal_of_simple_contracts_by_consumer,solution>>. To
define the second message contract;

. Set the `eligible` property in the response body to `false`.
. Update the label to `rejected_verification`.
. Update the description.

====  Setting up Spring Cloud Contract in the Producer Contracts Config File inside the Contracts Repo

For a repository with contracts, we need a way for the consumer to convert the contracts
into stubs and install them locally. At the moment, the easiest way is to use of Maven or
Gradle. In this tutorial, we use Maven. You can see how the `pom.xml` should look in
`beer_contracts/example/pom.xml` and in the following example:

[source,xml]
----
include::{contracts}/example/pom.xml[tags=config]
</project>
----
* This configuration file:
** Sets the jar name to the `beer-api-producer-external` (that's how the producer's
called).
** Disables test generation (we want only to generate stubs).
** Adds the Spring Cloud Contract plugin (as you can see, there is no configuration
related to base classes).
** Sets `excludeBuildFolders`, which is pretty descriptive. When generating stubs,
`target` and `build` folders are generated, and we don't want them in the output jar.
** Sets `contractsDirectory`. By default, Spring Cloud Contract searches under the
`src/test/resources/contracts` folder. In this case, we have the contracts under `/`
(from the point of view of the `pom.xml` file).

Now, as consumers, we want to convert the contracts into stubs so that we can use the
API. We use Maven to achieve that.

IMPORTANT: You must have a standalone version of Maven installed!
+
[source,bash]
----
$ mvn clean install
----
Now you have successfully installed the stubs locally.

You can check out the
`target/stubs/META-INF/com.example/beer-api-producer/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` folder. In there,
you see the `contracts` folder, where all contracts were copied, and the `mappings`
folder, where you can find all the generated stubs. By default, Spring Cloud Contract
uses  http://wiremock.org[WireMock] as an implementation of fake HTTP server. Under the
`beer/rest` subfolder, you can see all the generated stubs. Notice that we use JSON Paths
to check the contents of the request.

include::snippets/consumer_implementation.adoc[]

include::snippets/consumer_implementation_2.adoc[]

Congratulations! As a consumer, you successfully used the API of the producer for both
HTTP and messaging. Now you can file a pull request (PR) to the repository that stores
all contracts.

=== Producer Flow 1

image::{images_folder}/external_producer_flow_1.png[title="Producer takes over the PR filed to the repo with contracts, writes missing impl on the producer side"]

==== IDE setup

Open `producer_with_external_contracts` project (either via Maven or Gradle) in your IDE.

This tutorial assumes that you have taken over the PR of the `beer_contracts`. The
following git commands show an example of how to do so for a PR that got submitted to via
a branch called `the_pr`:

[source,bash]
----
git fetch origin
git checkout -b the_pr origin/the_pr
git merge master
----

The core idea of Spring Cloud Contract is stub and contract validity. Right now, you have
a set of contracts defined but haven't tested it against the producer side. It's time to
change that!

==== Install the Contracts Locally

In order for the producer to use the contracts, we need to produce a JAR with all the
contracts. To achieve that, use Maven's assembly plugin. You can find the configuration
under `beer_contracts/src/assembly/contracts.xml`. We still need to configure the
`beer_contracts/pom.xml` by providing the assembly plugin configuration.

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-assembly-plugin</artifactId>
  <executions>
      <execution>
          <id>contracts</id>
          <phase>prepare-package</phase>
          <goals>
              <goal>single</goal>
          </goals>
          <configuration>
              <attach>true</attach>
              <descriptor>${basedir}/src/assembly/contracts.xml</descriptor>
              <appendAssemblyId>false</appendAssemblyId>
          </configuration>
      </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
----
The preceding snippet creates a `beer-contracts` JAR (in the `target` folder) that
contains all contracts and poms from `src/main/resources/contracts`.

==== Setting up the Spring Cloud Contract Dependencies on the Producer Side

First, let's add the Spring Cloud Contract Verifier dependency to the project, as shown
in the following snippet:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier</artifactId>
	<scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
testCompile("org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier")
----
Spring Cloud Contract can generate tests from your contracts to ensure that your
implementation's API is compatible with the defined contract. Let's set up the project to
start generating tests.

Spring Cloud Contract needs a base class that all of the generated tests will extend.
Currently, we support three different ways of defining a base class (you can read more
about this in the Spring Cloud Contract documentation for
https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html#_configure_plugin[Gradle]
and https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html#_configure_plugin_2[Maven]).


* A single class for all tests.
* Convention-based naming (which takes the last two package names and appends `Base`. For
example, a contract `src/test/resources/contracts/foo/bar/shouldDoSth.groovy` creates a
test class called `BarTest` that would extend the `FooBarBase` class.
* Manual mapping (you can state that contracts matching certain regular expressions must
have a base class with fully qualified name equal to the value you specify).

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${spring-cloud-contract.version}</version>
    <extensions>true</extensions>
    <configuration>
        <baseClassMappings>
            <baseClassMapping>
                <contractPackageRegex>.*messaging.*</contractPackageRegex>
                <baseClassFQN>com.example.BeerMessagingBase</baseClassFQN>
            </baseClassMapping>
            <baseClassMapping>
                <contractPackageRegex>.*rest.*</contractPackageRegex>
                <baseClassFQN>com.example.BeerRestBase</baseClassFQN>
            </baseClassMapping>
        </baseClassMappings>
        <!-- We want to use the JAR with contracts with the following coordinates -->
        <contractDependency>
            <groupId>com.example</groupId>
            <artifactId>beer-contracts</artifactId>
        </contractDependency>
        <!-- The JAR with contracts should be taken from Maven local -->
        <contractsMode>LOCAL</contractsMode>
        <!-- Base package for generated tests -->
        <basePackageForTests>com.example</basePackageForTests>
    </configuration>
    <!-- this was added for testing purposes only -->
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-contract-verifier</artifactId>
            <version>${spring-cloud-contract.version}</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</plugin>
----

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
contracts {
	// We want to use the JAR with contracts with the following coordinates
	contractDependency {
		stringNotation = 'com.example:beer-contracts'
	}
	// The JAR with contracts should be taken from Maven local
	contractsMode = "LOCAL"
	// Base package for generated tests
	basePackageForTests = "com.example"
	baseClassMappings {
		baseClassMapping(".*messaging.*", "com.example.BeerMessagingBase")
		baseClassMapping(".*rest.*", "com.example.BeerRestBase")
	}
}
----

In both cases, we define that we want to download the JAR with contracts with given
coordinates (`com.example:beer-contracts`).

We do not provide the `contractsRepositoryUrl` (the URL from which we expect the
contracts to be downloaded), because we want to work offline. That's why we set the
`contractsWorkOffline` flag.

We decided that all the generated tests should be generated under the `com.example`
package instead of the default one.

We have manually set mappings of packages in which contracts are stored to a fully
qualified name of the base class. If there's a contract that has a `messaging` package
name in its path, it will be mapped to a `com.example.BeerMessagingBase` base class.

==== Updating Contracts from the Pull Request

include::snippets/updating_messaging_contracts_from_pr.adoc[]

IMPORTANT: Remember to rebuild the JAR with contracts in the `beer_contracts` repo. You
need to produce and install the JAR in your Maven local.

include::snippets/producer_implementation.adoc[]

=== Producer Flow 2

image::{images_folder}/external_producer_flow_2.png[title="Once done the producer merges the PR to the repo with contracts. The CI system will produce a JAR with all contracts"]

- Now you would merge the PR from `beer_contracts` repo to master and your CI system would build a fat jar and stubs

=== Producer Flow 3

image::{images_folder}/external_producer_flow_3.png[title="Once the PR got merged, the CI built the JAR of the contracts repo then the producer's code can use that JAR in its own building process"]

After the pull request gets merged and the `beer-contracts` artifact gets published, you
need to switch off your offline work in the Spring Cloud Contract (we do not do so for
this tutorial). In a "real life" situation you would need to update it as shown in the
following snippet:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]

    <configuration>
        <baseClassMappings>

                <contractPackageRegex>.*messaging.*</contractPackageRegex>
                <baseClassFQN>com.example.BeerMessagingBase</baseClassFQN>

                <baseClassFQN>com.example.BeerRestBase</baseClassFQN>
            </baseClassMapping>
        </baseClassMappings>
        <!-- We want to use the JAR with contracts with the following coordinates -->
        <contractDependency>
            <groupId>com.example</groupId>
            <artifactId>beer-contracts</artifactId>
        </contractDependency>
        <!-- The JAR with contracts will get downloaded from an external repo -->
        <contractsRepositoryUrl>http://foo.bar/baz</contractsRepositoryUrl>
        <!-- Base package for generated tests -->
        <basePackageForTests>com.example</basePackageForTests>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]

contracts {
	// We want to use the JAR with contracts with the following coordinates
	contractDependency {

}
