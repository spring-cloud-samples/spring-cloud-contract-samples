=== Consumer flow 2

image::{images_folder}/consumer_flow_2.png[title="Switch to work online"]

- After merging the PR the producer's stubs reside in some Artifactory / Nexus instance
- As consumers we no longer want to retrieve the stubs from our local Maven repository -
we'd like to download them from the remote location
- To do that (we won't do that for the tutorial but you would do it in your "production"
code) it's enough to pass the `repositoryRoot` parameter and set the
`stubsMode` to `StubRunnerProperties.StubsMode.REMOTE`

  * Another option is to pass the property `stubrunner.repositoryRoot` either as a
   system / environment property, or via an `application.yml` and `stubrunner.stubs-mode`
   equal to `remote`
