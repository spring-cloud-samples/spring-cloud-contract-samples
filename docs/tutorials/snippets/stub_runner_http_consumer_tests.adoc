- Now it's time to turn on the magic! Let's add the Spring Cloud Starter Contract Stub Runner test dependency.
include::consumer_stub_runner_dep.adoc[]
- We can annotate our test class with
`@AutoConfigureStubRunner(workOffline = true, ids = "com.example:{producer_artifact}:+:stubs:8090")`. What that
will do is:
  * it will download the stub JARs from Maven local (`workOffline=true`)
  * it will search for a JAR with coordinates `com.example:{producer_artifact}` with latest version (`+`)
  and `stubs` classifier. Once it's found the fake HTTP server stub will be started at port `8090`
- Rerun the test - it should automagically pass!
 * In the logs you will see information about downloading, unpacking and starting stubs (<<_stub_logs,see the logs>>)
 * What happened is that we could interact with real API without writing a single line of production code
