= Stub Runner Boot {version}

In this tutorial, we check out the basic functionality of the Stub Runner Boot
application. Stub Runner Boot is a standalone JAR that you can run to download the latest
stubs and have them started in fake HTTP servers.

We demonstrate only the HTTP side of the Stub Runner Boot. However, the tool is far more
powerful. There are also options to:

* End messages defined in contracts to real queues.
* Register the stubs in a real discovery service.

== Adding the Stout Endpoint

Let's open the `producer_advanced` project and define a new endpoint called `/stout`.
We can start with a contract. Let's call it `shouldReturnStout.groovy`:

[source,groovy]
----
Contract.make {
	request {
		method 'GET'
		url '/stout'
	}
	response {
		status 200
		body("STOUT")
		headers {
			contentType(textPlain())
		}
	}
}
----

Now, let's create the `StoutController`, as follows:

[source,java]
----
@RestController
public class StoutController {

	@GetMapping("/stout")
	String stout() {
		return "STOUT";
	}
}
----

In `BeerRestBase`, we need to add another controller to RestAssured, as follows:

[source,java]
----
RestAssuredMockMvc.standaloneSetup(..., new StoutController(), ...);
----

Let's install the stubs locally, as shown for both Maven and Gradle in the following
code snippet:

[source,bash,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
./mvnw clean install
----
+
[source,bash,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal
----
- Great! Now let's move to a terminal.

== Running Stub Runner Boot

Stub Runner Boot is a fat JAR that can be configured via a single annotation. We will use
an already packaged JAR, so you don't need to follow these steps. You can:
* add the stub runner starter to the classpath, as follows:
`include::snippets/consumer_stub_runner_dep.adoc[]`.
* annotate your main class with `@EnableStubRunnerServer`.

The following class shows an example of such a class:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableStubRunnerServer
public class StubRunnerBoot {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(StubRunnerBoot.class, args);
	}
}
----

We can download a prepackaged JAR, as follows:

[source,bash]
----
include::{root}/scripts/stub_runner_boot.sh[tags=download]
----

Now let's run the Stub Runner Boot application. We want to work in `offline` mode, and
we want to download the JAR containing the latest stubs of
`com.example:beer-api-producer-advanced` and start it on a random port. The following
script shows how to do all that:

[source,bash]
----
include::{root}/scripts/stub_runner_boot.sh[tags=run]
----

TIP: You can run the Stub Runner Boot without `nohup`, but then you have to start a new
terminal window for the rest of this tutorial. If you check the `nohup.log` output file,
you can see that the app has started and it has downloaded the stubs locally. It has
started on port `8083`. Now let's `curl` a request to the `/stubs` and try to retrieve
the port on which our stub has started. Once we have it, we can `curl` the `/stout`
endpoint.

[source,bash]
----
include::{root}/scripts/stub_runner_boot.sh[tags=test]
----

We should get a `STOUT` string on the terminal.

TIP: There are also  `/trigger` endpoints available if you want to trigger some messaging
labels. You can read more about them in the https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html#_stub_runner_boot_application[docs].
For the http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-pipelines/spring-cloud-pipelines.html[Spring
Cloud Pipelines] project, we have a Stub Runner Boot application that uses a real
instance of RabbitMQ for messaging and registers stubs in Eureka. You can check the code
https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[here].

IMPORTANT: Remember to kill the Stub Runner application. You can do so with the following
command:
`pkill -f stub-runner-boot`
