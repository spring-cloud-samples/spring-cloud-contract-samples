= Contracts on the Producer side {version}

In this tutorial, we keep the contracts together with the producer code. On the consumer
side, we be using Service Discovery.

== Tutorial

Using Consumer Driven Contracts is like using TDD at the architecture level. We start by
writing a test on the consumer side.

=== Consumer flow 1

image::{images_folder}/consumer_flow_1.png[title="Interact with cloned producer code"]

Let's go back to our consumer code. We need to look at `BeerControllerTest` and
`BeerController`. We know how we would like the API to look, so now we can write the
missing implementation in the `BeerController`.

TIP: Remember that, in order to use the load balancing features, we need to add the
`org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client` dependency.

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
compile("org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client")
----
Also, you need to register the `RestTemplate` bean as `@LoadBalanced`. Go to
the `ClientApplication` class and register the bean as follows:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
@LoadBalanced
RestTemplate restTemplate() {
    return new RestTemplate();
}
----

Now let's assume that we call the producer application by using the
`http://somenameforproducer/check` URL. You need to provide some properties to tell Stub
Runner that the given service name (in our case, `somenameforproducer`) should be mapped
to the running HTTP server stub of a given producer. Let's set those properties.
Stub Runner requires you to set the `stubrunner.idsToServiceIds` mapping in which the key
is the artifact ID and the value is the service name in the code. You also need to define
the `idsToServiceIds` property, as shown in the following code:

[source,yml]
----
stubrunner:
  idsToServiceIds:
    beer-api-producer: somenameforproducer
----

When you call the URL `http://somenameforproducer/check`, it will get redirected to a
fake HTTP instance that was started with the `beer-api-producer` stubs JAR. We know how
the API needs to look, so we can now go ahead and try to write the missing implementation
of the `BeerController`.

==== Playing with the HTTP Contracts

Congratulations! As a consumer, you have successfully used the API of the producer for
both HTTP and messaging. Now you can file a pull request (PR) to the producer code with
the proposal of the contract,

Let's switch to the producer side.

=== Producer Flow 1

==== Updating Contracts from the PR

include::snippets/producer_http_tests.adoc[]

Now you could merge the PR to master, and your CI system would build a fat jar and the
stubs.

Congratulations! You've completed the producer side of this tutorial.
