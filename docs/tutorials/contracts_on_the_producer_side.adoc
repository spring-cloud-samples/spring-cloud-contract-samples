= Contracts on the producer side

In this tutorial we'll keep the contracts together with the producer code

== Tutorial

Consumer Driven Contract is like TDD on the layer of architecture. Let's start with writing a test on the
consumer side.

=== Consumer flow 1

image::{images_folder}/consumer_flow_1.png[title="Interact with cloned producer code"]

==== IDE setup

- Open in your IDE the `consumer` project (either via Maven or Gradle)
- We have two objectives for HTTP
  * when a client wants a beer and has
  e.g. name "marcin" and age 22 - the answer that we'll respond with `THERE YOU GO`
  * when a client is an underage and wants a beer and has
  e.g. name "marcin" and age 17 - the answer that we'll respond with `GET LOST`
- and we have two objectives for messaging
  * when a verification message with `eligible` field equal to `true` was sent to the `verifications` channel
  then we increment the `eligible` counter
  * when a verification message with `eligible` field equal to `false` was sent to the `verifications` channel
  then we increment the `notEligible` counter
- Let's start with HTTP.
- Open the `BeerControllerTest` test. Since CDC is like TDD we have 2 tests that describe our beer selling features.
and we're already providing some basic setup for you (in real TDD
example you'd have to code all of that yourself)
- Technically speaking for both cases we want to use `MockMvc` to send a request to the `/beer` endpoint
with a JSON pojo containing `name` and `age`. From the controller we want to send a request to
`http://localhost:8090/` where the producer will be waiting for out requests. Let's write the missing
tests body. (<<_written_consumer_tests,Show solution>>)
- The first step in TDD is `red` - let's run the tests and ensure that they are failing (in the controller
we return `null` instead of any meaningful value)
- The problem is such that we don't yet know what API we would like to have... This is where we touch
 the very essence of Consumer Driven Contracts. As consumers we want to drive the change of the API
 that's why, *as consumers*, we will work on the producer code.

==== Cloning the producer's code

- In this tutorial we will not clone the producer's code, we'll just open it in the IDE
- There's some production code written on the producer side but you could completely remove it. The idea
of CDC is that defining of contract can be done without writing a single line of code for the feature.

==== Adding dependencies in the producer's clone

- Since we want the IDE to help us with code completion, let's add the necessary Spring Cloud Contract
dependencies. You need to add `spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier` as a test dependency
(<<_adding_spring_cloud_contract_dependency,Show solution>>)
- This is a task that you would do once only since when you'll be adding next contracts
all the dependencies w

==== Defining first HTTP contract

- Time to play with the API! Create a `src/test/resources/contracts/beer/rest` and
 `src/test/resources/contracts/beer/messaging` folders. (<<_proposal_of_simple_contracts_by_consumer,Show solution>>)
  * You can define the contracts using Groovy DSL. Let's create our first HTTP contract.
  * Under the `rest` folder create a file `shouldGrantABeerIfOldEnough.groovy`
  * Call the `Contract.make` method to start defining the contract
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {

}
----

  * You can call `description()` method to provide some meaningful description. TIP: You can use the
   Groovy multiline String `""" """` to have all special characters escaped. Every new line in the String
   will be converted into a new line character. Example
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        some interesting description
    """)
}
----

  * Now call the `request { }` and `response { }` methods
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        some interesting description
    """)
    request {
    }
    response {
    }
}
----

  * Let's assume that we're interested in sending a `POST` method. Call `method POST()` or `method "POST"`.
  TIP: In Groovy you don't need to provide parentheses (in most cases). You can write either `method POST()`
  or `method(POST())`. In both cases it's the same syntax
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        some interesting description
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
    }
    response {
    }
}
----
  * Now we need to provide some URL. Let it be `/check`. Let's write `url "/check"`
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        some interesting description
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/check"
    }
    response {
    }
}
----
  * Now time to define some body. We'll leverage some of the Groovy power over here so if you're lost
  you can always check the http://groovy-lang.org/json.html[Groovy JSON documentation]. Let's call the
  `body()` method with brackets.
  * In Groovy you can use the map notation in such a way `[key: "value", secondKey: 2]`. In the same way
  we can describe the body of a JSON. So in order to send a JSON looking like this `{ "age": 22, "name": "marcin" }`
  we can create a map notation of `[age:22, name:"marcin"]`. The `body` method accepts a map and in Groovy
  if a method accepts a map then the `[]` brackets can be omited. So you can either write
  `body([age:22, name:"marcin"])` or `body(age:22, name:"marcin")`. The latter one contains less boilerplate
  code so let's write that one
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        some interesting description
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/check"
        body(
            age: 22, name: "marcin"
            )
    }
    response {
    }
}
----
  * Now time for the headers... Call the `headers { }` method
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        some interesting description
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/check"
        body(
            age: 22, name: "marcin"
            )
        headers {

        }
    }
    response {
    }
}
----
  * Inside that method let's define that we want to use the `Content-Type: "application/json` header. Just
  call `contentType(applicationJson())` methods
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        some interesting description
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/check"
        body(
            age: 22, name: "marcin"
            )
        headers {
            contentType(applicationJson())
        }
    }
    response {
    }
}
----
  * Congratulations! You defined how you would like the contract for the request to look like! Time for the
  response
  * In the `response` block we would like to define that that the status of our response will be 200.
  Just call `status 200`
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        some interesting description
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/check"
        body(
            age: 22, name: "marcin"
            )
        headers {
            contentType(applicationJson())
        }
    }
    response {
        status 200
    }
}
----
  * We'd like our response to have some body. As you could have assumed there's a `body` method here too.
  We'll now use another way of defining bodies (which is the less preferred option in Spring Cloud Contract
  but still can be useful) - using String
  * We're assuming that we would like to send back a field called `status` that will return `OK` when the
  person can get the beer
  * Call the `body(""" { "status" : "OK" } """)`. That way you're defining how the response body will look like
  by providing the exact JSON value
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        some interesting description
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/check"
        body(
            age: 22, name: "marcin"
            )
        headers {
            contentType(applicationJson())
        }
    }
    response {
        status 200
        body("""
            { "status" : "OK" }
        """)
    }
}
----
  * Last thing to add are the response headers. We're doing exactly the same thing as we have done previously
  for the request. `headers { contentType(applicationJson()) }`.
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        some interesting description
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/check"
        body(
            age: 22, name: "marcin"
            )
        headers {
            contentType(applicationJson())
        }
    }
    response {
        status 200
        body("""
            { "status" : "OK" }
        """)
        headers {
            contentType(applicationJson())
        }
    }
}
----
  * Congratulations! You have created your first contract!

==== Defining second HTTP contract

- Time for you to create the second contract. Create a file called `shouldRejectABeerIfTooYoung.groovy`.
If you're lost just check out the <<_proposal_of_simple_contracts_by_consumer,solution>>
  * Set the `age` in the request to `17`
  * Update the response body to return a `status` equal to `NOT_OK`.
  * Update the description

==== Defining first messaging contract

- Ok we've done the case for HTTP. Time to define some contracts for messaging. Under the `src/test/resources/contracts/beer/messaging`
create a `shouldSendAcceptedVerification.groovy` file. If you're lost just check out the <<_proposal_of_simple_contracts_by_consumer,solution>>
  * Call the `org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make { }` method to start defining the contract
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
}
----
  * You can call `description()` method to provide some meaningful description. TIP: You can use the
   Groovy multiline String `""" """` to have all special characters escaped. Every new line in the String
   will be converted into a new line character
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        some interesting description
    """)
}
----
  * HTTP communication is synchronous - you send a request and you get a response. With messaging the situation
  is different - a consumer suddenly might get a message. In the consumer tests the consumer needs a mean to
  trigger that message. That hook is called a `label` in Spring Cloud Contract. Let's call our label
  `accepted_verification`. To define it in the contract just call the `label` method like this
  `label 'accepted_verification'`
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        some interesting description
    """)
    label "accepted_verification"
}
----
  * Next we define the message that we would like to receive. So from the producer's perspective that's an
  `outputMessage`. You can call that message in the Groovy DSL `outputMessage { }`
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        some interesting description
    """)
    label "accepted_verification"
    outputMessage {

    }
}
----
  * Inside that method we need to define where and what we want to send. Let's start with the first.
  You can call the `sentTo` method and provide the destination. According to the requirements we want
  to send the message to the `verifications` channel. Let's define that in the contract
  by calling `sentTo 'verifications'`
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        some interesting description
    """)
    label "accepted_verification"
    outputMessage {
        sentTo "verifications"
    }
}
----
  * As for the body we just can call `body(eligible: true)`. That way we'll send a JSON body via messaging
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        some interesting description
    """)
    label "accepted_verification"
    outputMessage {
        sentTo "verifications"
        body(eligible: true)
    }
}
----
  * We can also set headers on the message. Let's call `headers { }` method and inside the closure we can set an
  explicit header. In case of messaging with Spring Cloud Stream, a header that describes the content
  type of the payload is called `contentType`. So we need to set it like this
  `header("contentType", applicationJsonUtf8())`.
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        some interesting description
    """)
    label "accepted_verification"
    outputMessage {
        sentTo "verifications"
        body(eligible: true)
        headers {
            header("contentType", applicationJsonUtf8())
        }
    }
}
----
  * Congratulations! You've created your first messaging contract!

==== Defining second messaging contract

- Time for you to create the second contract. Create a file called `shouldSendRejectedVerification.groovy`.
If you're lost just check out the <<_proposal_of_simple_contracts_by_consumer,solution>>
  * Set the `eligible` in the response body to `false`
  * Update the label to `rejected_verification`
  * Update the description

==== Setting up the Spring Cloud Contract plugin on the producer side

- Ok, at this moment we've described the API that would be interesting for us, consumers, and most likely
will suit our needs. We define those contracts cause we want to have some stubs produced for us without
needing to write a single line of the implementation code. The tool that we need to do this conversion
is the Spring Cloud Contract plugin. Let's add it to the producer's `pom.xml` / `build.gradle`.
(<<_adding_spring_cloud_contract_plugin,Show solution>>)
  * The coordinates of the plugin are: `org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-contract-gradle-plugin:${version}`
  * For this tutorial we're using latest snapshot versions that you can reference via the Maven's
  `${spring-cloud-contract.version}` property or Gradle's `verifierVersion` one
  * Once the plugin has been added just call the commands to install the stubs locally
+
[source,bash,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
$ ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
----
+
[source,bash,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
$ ./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal -x test
----
  * Now you can check out `target/stubs/META-INF/com.example/beer-api-producer/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` for Maven or
  `build/stubs/META-INF/com.example/beer-api-producer/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` for Gradle. Over there you'll see
  `contracts` folder where all contracts got copied and the `mappings` folder where you'll find all the
  generated stubs. By default Spring Cloud Contract uses http://wiremock.org[WireMock] as an implementation
  of fake HTTP server. Under the `beer/rest` subfolder you'll see all the generated stubs. Notice that
  we're using JSON Paths to check the contents of the request.

==== Writing the missing consumer HTTP implementation

- Let's go back to our, consumer's code - let's go back to the `BeerControllerTest` and `BeerController`.
We know how we would like the API to look like so now we can write the missing implementation in the
`BeerController`. Let's assume that the producer application will be running at
 `http://localhost:8090/` (<<_missing_consumer_controller_code,Show solution>>)

==== Turning on Stub Runner in HTTP consumer tests

- Let's run the `BeerControllerTest` again. It will fail since we're trying to send a request to
a real instance that hasn't been started
- Now it's time to turn on the magic! Let's add the Spring Cloud Starter Contract Stub Runner test dependency.
(<<_adding_spring_cloud_contract_stub_runner,Show solution>>)
- In `BeerControllerTest` we can annotate the class with
`@AutoConfigureStubRunner(workOffline = true, ids = "com.example:beer-api-producer:+:stubs:8090")`. What that
will do is:
  * it will download the stub JARs from Maven local (`workOffline=true`)
  * it will search for a JAR with coordinates `com.example:beer-api-producer` with latest version (`+`)
  and `stubs` classifier. Once it's found the fake HTTP server stub will be started at port `8090`
- Rerun the test - it should automagically pass!
 * In the logs you will see information about downloading, unpacking and starting stubs (<<_stub_logs,see the logs>>)
 * What happened is that we could interact with real API without writing a single line of production code

==== Playing with the HTTP contracts

- TDD is about red, green and refactor. We went through the first two. Time to refactor the code.
 We come to the conclusion that the `name` field is unnecessary. In the `BeerController.java` file let's
 create a new class called `BeerRequest` that will contain only age field and let's try to send that
 to our stubbed producer. (<<_beer_request,Show solution>>)
- Let's run the tests again - what will happen is that the tests will fail. That's because in the contract
you have explicitly described that you want the `name` to be there. As you can see all the typos will be
caught during the build time of your project.
  * The same will happen if you leave the `name` but change the `age` to some other value (e.g. 28).
  Our stubs at the moment are very strict. We'll try to fix that in a second
- To fix this you need to go back with your IDE to the producer and modify your HTTP contracts.
  * Just remove the `name` field from the request body.
  * Spring Cloud Contract allows you to provide dynamic values for parts of body, urls, headers etc.
  This is especially useful when working with dates, database ids, UUIDs etc.
  * Let's open the `shouldGrantABeerIfOldEnough.groovy` and go to the request body `age` element
  * Instead of `22` write `$(regex('[2-9][0-9]'))`. Now let's analyze what this is.
    ** In order to tell Spring Cloud Contract that there will be a dynamic value set you have to use either
    the `$()` or `value()` method. They are equivalent.
    ** Next we use `regex()` method that converts your `String` into `Pattern`. In this case we assume
    a 2 digit number greater or equal to `20`
  * Repeat the same process for the `shouldRejectABeerIfTooYoung.groovy` contract but change the
  regular expression to `[0-1][0-9]`
  * Run the building with test skipping and check the output of stubs. You'll see that the generated
  mappings have changed from equality check in JSON Path to regular expression check
  * Go back to the consumer code and run the `BeerControlerTest` again. This time it should pass. You can
  also change the values of age to e.g. `45` for the positive case and `11` for the negative on.

==== Writing the missing consumer messaging implementation

- We've gone through the HTTP scenario and now it's time for the messaging part.
- Let' start with a test as usual. Let's check out the `BeerVerificationListenerTest` test class
  * there are 2 test methods with empty bodies
  * in both cases we need to trigger a message that will get sent to a destination at which our
  listener class is awaiting messages
  * we're missing the triggering part - but we'll add it in a second
- On the consumer side let's check out the `BeerVerificationListener` class.
  * We're using the Spring Cloud Stream's abstraction of a queue / topic which is called a `channel`.
  * There are 2 channels that come out od the box with SC-Stream. These are `input` and `output`.
  Those channels can be found in 2 interfaces - `Sink` and `Source`. `Sink` contains the `input` channel
  which is used for listening for messages and `Source` contains the `output` channel which
  is used to send messages. In the listener class you can see that we use the `Sink` one cause we're waiting for
  a message to be received.
  * We have to configure the `destination`, so the actual name of a queue / topic on which we will be
  listening. To do that you have to set in the `src/main/resources/application.yml` the property
  `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination: verifications`. That means that the we'll use the
  `input` channel (so the channel in the `Sink` interface) to listen to messages coming from a
  destination called `verifications`.
  * Now that we have configured Spring Cloud Stream let's write the missing feature. If the `eligible` flag
  in the incoming message is `true` - increase the `eligibleCounter` value. Otherwise increment the
  other `notEligibleCounter` one. (<<_missing_listener_code,Show solution>>)
- Now that the implementation is written - let's try to run our `BeerVerificationListenerTest` tests.
Unfortunately they will fail cause no message has been received - we'll still missing that part

==== Turning on Stub Runner in messaging consumer tests

- Time to use Spring Cloud Contract!
  * We need to use Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner so that it downloads the stubs. Just add the
  `@AutoConfigureStubRunner(workOffline = true, ids = "com.example:beer-api-producer")` to download
  the latest stubs of `com.example:beer-api-producer`, with classifier `stubs` and if the JAR
  contains any HTTP stubs then register them at a random port.
  * Now we need a solution to trigger the message. To do that we need to autowire a `StubTrigger` interface.
  Just add `@Autowired StubTrigger stubTrigger` field to your test
  * In the contract on the producer side we've described 2 labels. `accepted_verification` and `rejected_verification`.
  You can use the `StubTrigger#trigger` method to trigger a message with a given label. For example
  if you call `stubTrigger.trigger("accepted_verification")` you'll trigger a message that got described
  with the `accepted_verification` label.
  * Now add the missing `StubTrigger#tigger` method in the test bodies. (<<_missing_triggers,Show solution>>)
  * Run the tests and they should pass!
    * You can change the `destination` name in `src/main/resources/application.yml` to `foo` and rerun the
    tests - you'll see that they'll start failing. That's because you're listening to messages
    at destination `foo` whereas the message is sent to `verifications`
    * You can also play around with the `Verification` payload class. If you change the field name from
    `eligible` to `foo` an rerun the tests - the tests will fail. If you change the type from `boolean`
    to `Integer` (and change the production code too) then the tests will fail due to serialization problems
- Congratulations! As consumers - we've successfully played around with the API of the producer both for
HTTP and messaging. Now we're filing a PR to their code with the proposal of contract and let's switch to
the producer side.

=== Producer flow 1

image::{images_folder}/producer_flow_1.png[title="Producer takes over the PR, writes missing impl and merges the PR"]

==== IDE setup

- Open in your IDE the `producer` project (either via Maven or Gradle)
- We're assuming that we've taken over the PR. Example of how to achieve that in "real life" for a PR
that got submitted to via a branch called `the_pr` looks like this:

[source,bash]
----
git fetch origin
git checkout -b the_pr origin/the_pr
git merge master
----

- The idea of Spring Cloud Contract is about stub and contract validity. Right now we have a set of
 contracts defined but we haven't tested it against the producer side. Time to change that!

==== Setting up the Spring Cloud Contract plugin

- Spring Cloud Contract can generate tests from your contracts to ensure that your implementation's API
is compatible with the defined contract. Let's set up the project to start generating tests.
  * Spring Cloud Contract needs a base class that all of the generated tests will extend. Currently
  we support 3 different ways of defining a base class (you can read more about this in the
  Spring Cloud Contract documentation for https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html#_configure_plugin[Gradle]
  and https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html#_configure_plugin_2[Maven])
    ** a single class for all tests
    ** convention based naming (takes 2 last package names and appends `Base`. Having a contract
    `src/test/resources/contracts/foo/bar/shouldDoSth.groovy` would create a test class called
    `BarTest` that would extend `FooBarBase` class.
    ** manual mapping (you can state that contracts matching certain regular expression will have to
    have a base class with fully qualified name equal to X)
  * In the following example we'll play with convention based naming
    ** For Maven under the plugin setup you have to set up the plugin configuration
    `<configuration><packageWithBaseClasses>com.example</packageWithBaseClasses></configuration>`

==== Updating contracts from the PR

- We need to modify the messaging contracts cause they are missing one important piece from the
producer's perspective - the `input` part
  * In case of messaging there has to be some trigger that will result in producing an output message
  * Spring Cloud Contract accepts 3 situations
    ** Input message produces an output message
    ** A method execution produces an output message
    ** Input message doesn't produce any output message
  * In our situation we'll have a method produce an output. It's enough to pass the `input {}` method
    and then the `triggeredBy` method. The `triggeredBy` method requires a String with a method execution.
    So if in the base class we expect to have a method called `triggerSomeMessage()` that would trigger a message
    for tests, then we would write `input { triggeredBy("triggerSomeMessage()") }` to make this happen. Example:
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        some interesting description
    """)
    label "accepted_verification"
    input {
        triggeredBy("triggerSomeMessage()")
    }
    outputMessage {
        sentTo "verifications"
        body(eligible: true)
        headers {
            header("contentType", applicationJsonUtf8())
        }
    }
}
----
  * For this workshop for the `shouldSendAcceptedVerification.groovy` we want to trigger the `clientIsOldEnough()`
    method and for `shouldSendRejectedVerification.groovy` we want to trigger the `clientIsTooYoung()` method
from the base class. (<<_messaging_dsls,Show solution>>)

==== Generating tests from contracts

- Let's generate the tests! Just call:
+
[source,bash,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
$ ./mvnw clean install
----
+
[source,bash,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
$ ./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal
----
  * Suddenly some tests should start failing. Those tests are the autogenerated tests created
  by Spring Cloud Contract
  * The tests lay under `/generated-test-sources/contracts/org/springframework/cloud/contract/verifier/tests/beer`
    in `target` for Maven or `build` for Gradle
  * There will be a test for each folder in which you store your contracts. The name of the test class
    will be the name of that folder
  * Each of the contracts will be a single test inside that test class
  * If you check out the generated `RestTest` you'll notice that the dynamic parts of the `request` part
    of the contract got converted to a concrete value. Any dynamic bits on the `response` side would be
    converted into matchers.
- Time to fix the broken tests. We need to do that by providing the missing implementation.

==== Fixing broken HTTP tests

- Let's start with HTTP
  * First let's write the missing implementation in `ProducerController`. The logic to be written
    is extremely simple - if the `personCheckingService.shouldGetBeer(...)` returns `true` then we
    should return `new Response(BeerCheckStatus.OK)`. Otherwise `new Response(BeerCheckStatus.NOT_OK)`.
    (<<_producerController_implementation,Show solution>>)
- Let's fix the `BeerRestBase` class now
  * The idea of CDC is *NOT TO TEST* every single feature. Contract tests are there to see if the API
    is matched, *NOT* that the feature is working. That's why we shouldn't be accessing databases etc.
    That means that we will work with mock of the `PersonCheckingService`. (<<_beerrestbase,Show solution>>)
  * Let's annotate the test class with `@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)` to enable Mockito runner.
+
[source,java]
----
@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)
public abstract class BeerRestBase {
...
}
----
  * We'll want to test the `ProducerController` so we can create a field `@InjectMocks ProducerController
    producerController`. Mockito will inject any mocks for us via the constructor.
+
[source,java]
----
    @Mock PersonCheckingService personCheckingService;
    @InjectMocks ProducerController producerController;

    @Before
    public void setup() {
        given(personCheckingService.shouldGetBeer(argThat(oldEnough()))).willReturn(true);
    }
----
  * It won't compile cause we don't have the `oldEnough()` method but don't worry. So this line stubs
 the `shouldGetBeer` method in such a way that if the user is old enough then the method will return
 true. Let's now add the `oldEnoughMethod()`
+
[source,java]
----
	private TypeSafeMatcher<PersonToCheck> oldEnough() {
		return new TypeSafeMatcher<PersonToCheck>() {
			@Override protected boolean matchesSafely(PersonToCheck personToCheck) {
				return personToCheck.age >= 20;
			}
			@Override public void describeTo(Description description) {
			}
		};
	}
----
  * We're using the `TypeSafeMatcher` from Hamcrest to create a matcher for `PersonToCheck`. In this case
if the person to check is older or is 20 then the method `shouldGetBeer` method will return `true`.
  * Now we need to configure http://rest-assured.io/[RestAssured] that is used by Spring Cloud Contract
to send requests. In our case we want to profit from MockMvc. In order to set the `ProducerController`
with RestAssured it's enough to call `RestAssuredMockMvc.standaloneSetup(producerController);`
+
[source,java]
----
@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)
public abstract class BeerRestBase {

    @Mock PersonCheckingService personCheckingService;
    @InjectMocks ProducerController producerController;

    @Before
    public void setup() {
        given(personCheckingService.shouldGetBeer(argThat(oldEnough()))).willReturn(true);
        RestAssuredMockMvc.standaloneSetup(producerController);
    }

    private TypeSafeMatcher<PersonToCheck> oldEnough() {
        return new TypeSafeMatcher<PersonToCheck>() {
            @Override protected boolean matchesSafely(PersonToCheck personToCheck) {
                return personToCheck.age >= 20;
            }
            @Override public void describeTo(Description description) {
            }
        };
    }
}
----
  * With mocks and RestAssured setup - we're ready to run our HTTP based autogenerated tests

==== Fixing broken messaging tests

- Now let's go to the messaging part.
- Let's check out the `src/main/resources/application.yml` file whether it contains the proper
destination set for `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.destination`. If not then let's set it
to `verifications` - this is the queue / topic we'd like to receive the message from
- We're trying to do TDD so let's move to `BeerMessagingBase` test class. The first thing we need to do is to
add the `@AutoConfigureMessageVerifier` annotation on the test class. That will configure
the setup related to messaging and Spring Cloud Contract.
+
[source,java]
----
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = ProducerApplication.class, webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE)
@AutoConfigureMessageVerifier
public abstract class BeerMessagingBase {
...
}
----
- We need to prepare some setup for our tests. To do that we'll need to clear any remaining
messages that could break our tests. To do that we'll use the Spring Cloud Contract `MessageVerifier`
abstraction (it allows to send and receive messages from e.g. Spring Cloud Stream, Sprig Integration, Apache Camel.)
+
[source,java]
----
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = ProducerApplication.class, webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE)
@AutoConfigureMessageVerifier
public abstract class BeerMessagingBase {
    @Inject MessageVerifier messaging;
	@Autowired PersonCheckingService personCheckingService;

	@Before
	public void setup() {
		// let's clear any remaining messages
		// output == destination or channel name
		this.messaging.receive("output", 100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
	}

	public void clientIsOldEnough() {
    }

    public void clientIsTooYoung() {
    }
}
----
- In the `clientIsOldEnough()` and `clientIsTooYoung()` we need the logic to trigger a message.
What triggers a message will be the implementation of the `PersonCheckingService#shouldGetBeer`.
- For `clientIsOldEnough()` we can use a `PersonToCheck` of age `25` for example and
`clientIsTooYoung` can have age `5`. (<<_beermessagingbase,Show solution>>)
- We can run the test which will obviously fail because we have a missing implementation. Let's move
to `AgeCheckingPersonCheckingService`

==== Writing the missing producer messaging implementation

- We need to check if the person's age is greater or equal to 20 - if that's the case then the
we need to send the properly generated `Verification` object. In order to send a message you can use the
following code `source.output().send(MessageBuilder.withPayload(new Verification(true)).build())`.
In this case we're sending a message to the `output` channel (that is bound to `verifications` destination).
(<<_messaging_implementation,Show solution>>)
- Let's run the tests again - they should all pass!
- Now let's ensure that we can successfully publish artifacts to Maven local
+
[source,bash,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]

----
$ ./mvnw clean install
----
+
[source,bash,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]

----
$ ./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal
----
- Now you would merge the PR to master and your CI system will build a fat jar and stubs
- Congratulations - you've completed the producer side of this tutorial

=== Consumer flow 2

image::{images_folder}/consumer_flow_2.png[title="Switch to work online"]

- After merging the PR the producer's stubs reside in some Artifactory / Nexus instance
- As consumers we no longer want to retrieve the stubs from our local Maven repository -
we'd like to download them from the remote location
- To do that (we won't do that for the tutorial but you would do it in your "production"
code) it's enough to remove the `workOffline` flag and to pass the `repositoryRoot` parameter
+
[source,java]
----
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.MOCK)
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
@AutoConfigureJsonTesters
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(repositoryRoot="http://foo.com/bar,
ids = "com.example:beer-api-producer-with-scenario:+:stubs:8090")
@DirtiesContext
public class BeerControllerTest extends AbstractTest {
}
----
  * Another option is to pass the property `stubrunner.repositoryRoot` either as a
   system / environment property, or via an `application.yml`
