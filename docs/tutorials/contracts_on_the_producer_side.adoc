In this tutorial, we will keep the contracts together with the producer code.

== Tutorial

Using Consumer Driven Contracts is like using TDD at the architecture level. We start
with writing a test on the consumer side.

=== Consumer flow 1

- Congratulations! As a consumer, you have successfully used the API of the producer both
for HTTP and messaging. Now you can create a pull request (PR) to the consumer code with the
proposal of contract and switch to the producer side.

=== Producer Flow 1

==== Updating Contracts from the Pull Request

include::snippets/producer_implementation.adoc[]
Now you can merge the pull request to master and your CI system would build a fat jar and
the stubs. Congratulations! You have completed the producer side of this tutorial.
