= Using JUnit rule {version}

In this tutorial we'll reuse the code created in the link::stubs_per_consumer.html[stubs per consumer].
We'll write a test that instead of Stub Runner uses a JUnit rule to download and start stubs.
Also we will start stubs on random port, retrieve that port and set it on the controller.

IMPORTANT: This can be extremely useful when working with non-spring based applications on the
consumer side!

== The tests

- Let's open the `consumer_with_stubs_per_consumer` project
- In that project we have a `BeerControllerWithJUnitForBarTest` - let's open it
  * the test is ignored - let's remove that line
  * as you can see the tests looks like `BeerControllerForBarTest` but it doesn't use
  Stub Runner. If you run the test it will fail
- Let's add the missing JUnit Rule!
+
[source,java]
----
@Rule public StubRunnerRule rule = new StubRunnerRule()
----
- The `StubRunnerRule` is a fluent interface that allows you to set up the Stub Runner
functionality. In our case we would like to (<<_junit_rule,or copy from solutions>>)
   * download a stub with group id `com.example` and artifact id `beer-api-producer-with-stubs-per-consumer`
   * register it at port `8090`
   * work offline
   * turn on the stub per consumer feature
   * define that the consumer's name is `bar-consumer`
- Now if you run the test it will pass! But let's try to make the test better and randomize the port
- First, remove the `withPort` line - we want the port to be randomly picked
- The Rule has a method called `findStubUrl` - we can pass some coordinates to it
to get the URL of a running stub. If we get the URL, we can get the port and pass it to the
`BeerController`. Try it out (<<_port_setting,or copy from solutions>>)
- And that's it! You've successfully used the JUnit rule

TIP: You can check out the https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html#_stub_runner_junit_rule[documentation]
for more information and you can also play with the API of the rule.

IMPORTANT: To send messages via the rule you have to provide the `MessageVerifier`
interface yourself. If you're using Stub Runner, basing on the classpath we
can set one for you. If you're using a JUnit rule - you have to do that yourself.
