= Spring Cloud Contract with Rest Docs {version}

In this tutorial, we'll combine messaging contracts from the producer side with
generating stubs from Spring Rest Docs.

include::../scenarios.adoc[]

== Flow

image::{images_folder}/rest_docs_flow.png[title="Producer Contract flow"]

== Tutorial

This time, the producer defines the contracts and generates stubs. This is typically
the case when your application has many consumers and it would be very difficult to
take every consumer's opinion into account.

=== Producer flow 1

image::{images_folder}/rest_docs_producer_flow.png[title="Producer declares contracts and writes Rest Docs tests"]

==== IDE Setup for the Producer Scenario

To set up your IDE for this tutorial:

. In your IDE, open the `producer_with_restdocs` project (via either Maven or Gradle).
. Add the necessary dependencies, as shown in the next section.

==== Adding Dependencies to the Producer's Code

We'll use Rest Docs with Spring Cloud Contract to generate HTTP stubs, and
we'll write the DSL contracts for messaging. In order to add Rest Docs, add the following
test dependencies:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.restdocs</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-restdocs-mockmvc</artifactId>
    <optional>true</optional>
</dependency>
----

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
testCompile("org.springframework.restdocs:spring-restdocs-mockmvc")
----
In order to use Spring Cloud Contract Rest Docs integration, you have to add the
`spring-cloud-contract-wiremock` dependency. That way, we can generate the
http://wiremock.org[WireMock] stubs from our Rest Docs tests.

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-contract-wiremock</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
testCompile("org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-contract-wiremock")
----
To get the IDE to help us with code completion in writing DSL contracts, we can add the
necessary Spring Cloud Contract dependencies. You need to add
`spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier` as a test dependency

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier</artifactId>
	<scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
testCompile("org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier")
----

You need to this task only once, because, when you add contracts, all the dependencies
are already added.

==== Setting up the Spring Cloud Contract Plugin & Assembly Plugin

We need to use both the Spring Cloud Contract plugin & the assembly plugin. We use the
Spring Cloud Contract plugin to generate tests for messaging contracts. We use the
Assembly plugin to generate the JAR that holds the messaging contracts and HTTP stubs.

Spring Cloud Contract can generate tests from your contracts to ensure that your
implementation's API is compatible with the defined contract. Let's set up the project to
start generating messaging tests.

By default, Spring Cloud Contract plugin creates the  JAR  with stubs. We need to disable
that behavior.

Spring Cloud Contract needs a base class that all of the generated tests extend.
Currently, we support three different ways of defining a base class (you can read more
about this in the Spring Cloud Contract documentation for
https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html#_configure_plugin[Gradle]
and
https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html#_configure_plugin_2[Maven]):

* A single class for all tests.
* Convention-based naming (which takes the last two package names and appends `Base`. For
example, a contract `src/test/resources/contracts/foo/bar/shouldDoSth.groovy` creates a
test class called `BarTest` that would extend the `FooBarBase` class.
* Manual mapping (you can state that contracts matching certain regular expressions must
have a base class with fully qualified name equal to the value you specify).

In the following example, we use convention-based naming. For Maven, under the plugin
setup, you must set up the plugin configuration as follows:
`<configuration><packageWithBaseClasses>com.example</packageWithBaseClasses></configuration>`

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]

----
contracts {
    packageWithBaseClasses = 'com.example'
}
task stubsJar(type: Jar) {
	classifier = "stubs"
	into('/') {
		include('**/com/example/model/*.*')
		from("${project.rootDir}/src/main/java/")
	}
	into('/') {
		include('**/com/example/model/*.*')
		from("${project.buildDir}/classes/main")
	}
	into("META-INF/${project.group}/${project.name}/${project.version}/mappings") {
		include('**/*.*')
		from("${project.rootDir}/target/snippets/stubs")
	}
	into("META-INF/${project.group}/${project.name}/${project.version}/contracts") {
		include('**/*.groovy')
		from("${project.rootDir}/src/test/resources/contracts")
	}
}
// we need the tests to pass to build the stub jar
stubsJar.dependsOn(test)
// we want to disable the default Spring Cloud Contract stub jar generation
verifierStubsJar.enabled = false

artifacts {
	archives stubsJar
}
----

In both cases, passing that value tells the plugin that a given base class is available
under the `com.example` package. Also, it creates a stub jar in a custom way. For Maven,
it uses the assembly plugin with the configuration defined under `src/assembly/stub.xml`.
For Gradle, it uses the assembly plugin through the `stubsJar` task. The stubs jar
contains:
* The classes and sources of the POJO models.
* The contracts, under
`META-INF/${project.group}/${project.name}/${project.version}/contracts`.
* The stubs, under
`META-INF/${project.group}/${project.name}/${project.version}/mappings`.

An example for `com.example:beer-producer:0.0.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT` would be
`META-INF/com.example/beer-producer/0.0.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/contracts`.

==== Writing Your First Rest Docs Test

Open the `ProducerController` class. You can see that we already prepared some basic
setup for you. Our controller accepts a JSON request with a `PersonToCheck` body and
returns a JSON response of `Response` type. The logic that checks whether a person is
eligible to get beer is done via the `PersonCheckingService` interface.

We want to do TDD on the producer side, so let's start with a test. To do so, open the
`ProducerControllerTests` class. We need to add the Rest Docs support by annotating the
class in the following way:

[source,java]
----
@AutoConfigureRestDocs(outputDir = "target/snippets")
----

That way, any snippets produced by Rest Docs end up in the `target/snippets` folder. We
need to write two tests - one for the client who is old enough and one for a client
who is too young.

As you can see, we set up the Spring context. Doing so requires a fake
implementation of the `PersonCheckingService`, since we don't want to access any
databases, send messages, and so on. To do that in the `Config` class, at the bottom of
the test, you can register a bean of `PersonCheckingService` type that returns `true`
when the age of the `PersonToCheck` is greater than or equal to `20`.
(<<_rest_docs_producer_test_config,Show solution>>)

We use MockMvc to send a JSON request to the `/check` endpoint. The body of the request
is the prepared `PersonToCheck` object (hint: you can use the prepared `JacksonTester`
object to send that `json`. In the response, for the positive scenario, we expect the
response to set the `status` field equal to `OK`
(hint: `.andExpect(jsonPath("$.status").value("OK")))`
and set the `status` field for for the negative scenario equal to `NOT_OK` (hint:
`.andExpect(jsonPath("$.status").value("NOT_OK")))`.
(<<_rest_docs_producer_tests,Show solution>>)

Let's run the tests. They fail because we have yet to write any implementation on the
producer side. Let's fix that.

In the `ProducerController` class, write the missing implementation. If the
`PersonCheckingService` returns `true` when the `PersonToCheck` is eligible to get beer,
then return the `Response` with `BeerCheckStatus` equal to `OK`. Otherwise, the
`BeerCheckStatus` should equal `NOT_OK`.
(<<_producerController_implementation,Show solution>>)

Let's rerun the tests. Now they should pass. We have yet to create any stubs. It's time
to fix that.

Spring Cloud Contract WireMock comes with a handy method called
`WireMockRestDocs.verify()` that you can pass to the Rest Doc's `andDo()` method. The
`WireMockRestDocs.verify()` method lets you:

* Register the request and the response to store it as stub.
* Assert JSON path's of the request via `jsonPath` method (that's how you can check the
dynamic bits of your response).
* Check the content type of the request via the `contentType()` method.
* Save the stored request and response information as a WireMock stub via `stub()`
method.
* Access WireMock's API to perform further request verification via the `wiremock()`
method.

Spring Cloud Contract WireMock also comes with a
`SpringCloudContractRestDocs.dslContract()` method that lets you generate a DSL contract
from your Rest Docs tests. This can be handy when you have a lot of Rest Docs tests and
would like to migrate to DSL tests. If you call the `andDo()` method and pass to it the
`MockMvcRestDocumentation.document(...,...)`, you'll create a `dsl-contract.adoc` file
under the `target/snippets/shouldRejectABeerIfTooYoung` folder and
`shouldRejectABeerIfTooYoung.groovy` file under the `target/snippets/contracts/` folder.
The code to do so follows:

[source,java]
----
.andDo(MockMvcRestDocumentation
    .document("shouldRejectABeerIfTooYoung", SpringCloudContractRestDocs.dslContract()));
----

IMPORTANT: To make this work, you must first call the `WireMockRestDocs.verify()` method
and *only after* that call the `SpringCloudContractRestDocs.dslContract()` method.

Now you can add the Spring Cloud Contract Rest Docs support, as
(<<__rest_docs_producer_tests_with_contracts,shown here>>). To do so:

* For the positive scenario, assert that the `age` is greater or equal to `20` (hint: the
JSON path for this check is `$[?(@.age >= 20)]`).
* For the negative scenario, assert that the `age` is less than `20` (hint: the JSON path
for this check is `$[?(@.age < 20)]`)
* Assert that the request header contains a `content-type` of `applicaton/json` (hint:
you can use the `MediaType` method: `MediaType.valueOf("application/json")`).
* Produce the stub and `shouldGrantABeerIfOldEnough` the its documentation called for the
positive scenario.
* Produce the stub called `shouldRejectABeerIfTooYoung` and its DSL documentation for the
negative scenario.

Congratulations! In your `target/snippets` you should see:

* `contracts/shouldGrantABeerIfOldEnough.groovy`, which is a file with the DSL contract
for the positive scenario.
* `contracts/target/snippets/.groovy`, which is a file with the DSL contract for the
negative scenario.  // TODO Missing file name?
* `shouldGrantABeerIfOldEnough/`, which is a folder with `adoc` files containing
documentation of the positive scenario.
* `shouldRejectABeerIfTooYoung/`, which is a folder with `adoc` files containing
documentation of the negative scenario.
* `stubs/shouldGrantABeerIfOldEnough.json`, which is a WireMock stub of the positive
scenario.
* `stubs/shouldRejectABeerIfTooYoung.json`, which is a WireMock stub of the negative
scenario.

Now we xan define the messaging contracts.

==== Defining the First Messaging Contract

We've done the case for HTTP. Now we can move to the
`src/test/resources/contracts/beer/messaging` folder.

include::snippets/first_messaging_contract.adoc[]

include::snippets/updating_messaging_contracts_from_pr.adoc[]

==== Defining the Second Messaging Contract

Now you can create the second contract. Create a file called `shouldSendRejectedVerification.groovy`.
If you get lost, check out the <<_proposal_of_simple_contracts_by_consumer,solution>>. To
create the contract:

. Set the `eligible` property in the response body to `false`.
. Update the label to `rejected_verification`.
. Update the description.

==== Generating Tests from Contracts

Now we can generate the tests. To do so, call:
+
[source,bash,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
$ ./mvnw clean install
----

[source,bash,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
$ ./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal
----

Suddenly some tests should start failing. Those tests are the autogenerated tests created
by Spring Cloud Contract. The tests are under the
`/generated-test-sources/contracts/org/springframework/cloud/contract/verifier/tests/beer`
directory in the `target` directory for Maven or the `build` directory for Gradle.
There is a test for each folder in which you store your contracts. The name of the test
class is the name of that folder.

include::snippets/fixing_broken_messaging_tests.adoc[]

==== Checking the Generated JAR File

Let's check out what's inside the generated stub JAR. Assuming that our configuration is
OK, if you run the following command, you should see output that resembles the following:

[source,bash]

---------                     -------
     5875                     24 files
----

* Under `com/example/model`, you can see the compiled POJOs with sources.
* Under `META-INF/com.example/beer-api-producer-restdocs/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/contracts`, you
can see the messaging contracts.
* Under `META-INF/com.example/beer-api-producer-restdocs/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/mappings`, you
can see all the generated HTTP stubs.

In a "real life" scenario, we would merge our code into a fat jar, and a jar with stubs
would be generated by the CI system. In this tutorial, we work with our Maven local, so
that we don't have to do anything else.

Now we can move to the consumer side.

=== Consumer Flow 2

image::{images_folder}/consumer_flow_2.png[title="Online work with stubs"]

In this part of the tutorial, we show different ways of working with stubs:

* Using the `@AutoConfigureWireMock` annotation to manually pass a list of stubs to
register from the classpath.
* Using the `@AutoConfigureStubRunner` annotation with classpath scanning.
* Using the `@AutoConfigureStubRunner` annotation for offline work

IMPORTANT: This feature is available as of the Spring Cloud Contract 1.1.1.RELEASE.

==== Adding Spring Cloud Contract

To add Spring Cloud Contract, we'll do each of the following:

* <<contract-workshop-reading-http-stubs-from-classpath-wiremock>>
* <<contract-workshop-reading-http-stubs-from-classpath-stubrunner>>
* <<contract-workshop-writing-missing-consumer-messaging>>
* <<contract-workshop-reading-messaging-stubs-stubrunner>>
* <<contract-workshop-reading-messaging-stubs-classpath>>

[[contract-workshop-reading-http-stubs-from-classpath]]
==== Reading HTTP Stubs from the Classpath with Spring Cloud Contract WireMock

In your IDE, open the consumer code from the `consumer_with_restdocs` directory. We want
to do TDD, so let's open the `BeerControllerTest` class.

include::snippets/consumer_requirements.adoc[]

Since the producer has already published its stubs, we already know how the API looks.
Let's write the missing implementation for the `BeerController`.
(<<_missing_consumer_controller_code,Show solution>>)

If we run our tests again, they fail due to `Connection Refused`. That's because we try
to send a request to a non-started server.

Now you can turn on the magic! To do so, add the Spring Cloud Starter Contract Stub
Runner test dependency.

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-contract-stub-runner</artifactId>
	<scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
testCompile("org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-contract-stub-runner")
----

- Now we'll add the producer stub dependency to our project

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>beer-api-producer-restdocs</artifactId>
    <classifier>stubs</classifier>
    <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>*</groupId>
            <artifactId>*</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
----

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
testCompile("com.example:beer-api-producer-restdocs:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT:stubs") {
    transitive = false
}
----

IMPORTANT: Remember not to include any transitive dependencies. We want to import only
the JAR that contains the contracts and stubs.

Now we can annotate the `BeerControllerTest` class with
`@AutoConfigureWireMock(stubs = "classpath:/META-INF/com.example/beer-api-producer-restdocs/**/*.json", port = 8090)`

That annotation tells WireMock to start a fake HTTP server at port `8090` and to register
all stubs at the following location:

`/META-INF/com.example/beer-api-producer-restdocs/**/*.json` on the classpath

Let's run our tests again. Now they should pass!

[[contract-workshop-reading-http-stubs-from-classpath-stubrunner]]
==== Reading HTTP Stubs from the Classpath with Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner

IMPORTANT: This feature is available as of the 1.1.1.RELEASE version.

This part assumes that you have done the previous task so that your consumer project is
properly set up.

To read the stubs:

. Open the `BeerControllerClasspathTest`. We use Stub Runner to pick stubs from the
classpath.
. Now annotate the class with
`@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = "com.example:beer-api-producer-restdocs:+:8090")` without
passing the `workOffline` flag nor the `repositoryRoot`. Just pass the ID values.
. Run the tests and you can see them pass!

For this example, we scan the following locations by default:
* `/META-INF/com.example/beer-api-producer-restdocs/**/*.*`
* `/contracts/com.example/beer-api-producer-restdocs/**/*.*`
* `/mappings/com.example/beer-api-producer-restdocs/**/*.*`

==== Reading Messaging Stubs with the Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner

Since Rest Docs have nothing to do with messaging, we must use the standard Stub Runner
approach:

[[contract-workshop-reading-messaging-stubs-classpath]]
==== Reading Messaging Stubs from the Classpath with Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner

IMPORTANT: This feature is available as of the 1.1.1.RELEASE version

Now that you have written the implementation and have tested it in the previous section,
we can try to read the message stubs from classpath. To do so, annotate the
`BeerVerificationListenerClasspathTest` class with
`@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = "com.example:beer-api-producer-restdocs:+:8090")`
without passing the `workOffline` flag or the `repositoryRoot` flag. Pass only the `id`
values.

Now you can run the tests and see them tests pass!

For this example, we scan the following locations by default:
* `/META-INF/com.example/beer-api-producer-restdocs/**/*.*`
* `/contracts/com.example/beer-api-producer-restdocs/**/*.*`
* `/mappings/com.example/beer-api-producer-restdocs/**/*.*`
