= Spring Cloud Contract Advanced {version}

In this tutorial, we keep the contracts together with the producer code, and we check
out the more advanced concepts behind Spring Cloud Contract.

== Scenarios

We'll try to code the following scenario:

image::{images_folder}/grumpy_1.png[title="Grumpy bartender that doesn't want to sell any alcohol"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{images_folder}/grumpy_2.png[title="But the beer will always be sold to Josh Long"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

== Flow

image::{images_folder}/flow.png[title="Consumer Driven Contract flow"]

== Tutorial

Using Consumer Driven Contracts is like using TDD at the architecture level. We start by
writing a test on the consumer side.

=== Consumer Flow 1

image::{images_folder}/consumer_flow_1.png[title="Interact with cloned producer code"]

IMPORTANT: This tutorial assumes that you completed the previous tutorials and that the
consumer code has already been set up with appropriate dependencies.

Let's open the `GrumpyBartenderControllerTest`. The first step is to write the missing
implementation of the tests. Basing on the previously shown requirements, the controller
should resemble the following:

[source,java]
----
include::{consumer}/src/test/java/com/example/GrumpyBartenderControllerTest.java[tags=tests]
----
If we run the tests now, they fail. Let's now check out the producer's code
to define the missing contract. Open the `producer_advanced` project.

==== Cloned Producer

As usual in these tutorials, we do not clone the producer's code, even though we would do
so in a real life scenario.

Now let's write our contract! You can define the contracts with Groovy DSL. Let's create
our first HTTP contract. To do so:

. Under `src/test/resources/contracts/beer/rest/`, create a
`shouldNotSellAnyAlcohol.groovy` file.
. Call the `Contract.make` method to start defining the contract, as follows:

[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {

}
----

* You can call the `description()` method to provide some meaningful description.

TIP: You can use the Groovy multiline String `""" """` to have all special characters
escaped. Every new line in the String is converted into a new line character. The
following code shows an example:

[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        Represents a grumpy waiter that is too bored to sell any alcohol for anyone.
    """)
}
----

Now call the `request { }` and `response { }` methods, as shown below:

[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        Represents a grumpy waiter that is too bored to sell any alcohol for anyone.
    """)
    request {
    }
    response {
    }
}
----

Let's assume that we want to send a `POST` method. Call `method POST()` or `method "POST"`.

TIP: In Groovy, you don't need to provide parentheses (in most cases). You can write
either `method POST()` or `method(POST())`. In both cases, the effet is the same.

[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        Represents a grumpy waiter that is too bored to sell any alcohol for anyone.
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
    }
    response {
    }
}
----

Now we need to provide a URL. You can set it to `/buy` by writing `url "/buy"`, as shown
in the following code:

[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        Represents a grumpy waiter that is too bored to sell any alcohol for anyone.
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/buy"
    }
    response {
    }
}
----
Now it's time to define the body. We want to define `age` and `name` fields. Let's make
`name` accept any alpha unicode value. Let's make `age` be a concrete value at this time.
We will make it dynamic in the next step. The following code sets our initial values for
both fields:

[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        Represents a grumpy waiter that is too bored to sell any alcohol for anyone.
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/check"
        body(
            name: $(anyAlphaUnicode()),
            age: 25
            )
    }
    response {
    }
}
----
As you can see, we used the `$()` method where we've used the `anyAlphaUnicode()`
function to set a dynamic value.

Now we can make the `age` field be dynamic. In Spring Cloud Contract, you can either
provide the dynamic values directly in the body (as we have with the `name`) or via
`stubMatchers` and `testMatchers` sections. Let's use the first one. We define the JSON
path for which we want to define a dynamic value, as follows:

[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        Represents a grumpy waiter that is too bored to sell any alcohol for anyone.
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/check"
        body(
            name: $(anyAlphaUnicode()),
            age: 25
            )
    }
    stubMatchers {
        jsonPath('$.age', byRegex('[2-9][0-9]'))
    }
    response {
    }
}
----

Inside the `stubMatchers` section, we defined that an element matching a JSON path of
`$.age` has to match a regular expression of `[2-9][0-9]`. You can see that there are
methods other than `byRegex`. You can read about them in the
https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html#_dynamic_properties_in_matchers_sections[documentation].

IMPORTANT: If you provide a value via the matchers section, then the value for the key
for which you added the matching is *removed* from automatic test assertion generation.
You have to provide those values manually via the matchers section.

Now we can create the headers by calling the `headers { }` method, as shown in the
following code:

[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        Represents a grumpy waiter that is too bored to sell any alcohol for anyone.
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/check"
        body(
            name: $(anyAlphaUnicode()),
            age: 25
            )
        }
        stubMatchers {
            jsonPath('$.age', byRegex('[2-9][0-9]'))
        }
        headers {

        }
    }
    response {
    }
}
----
Inside that method, let's define that we want to use the
`Content-Type: "application/json"` header. Just call `contentType(applicationJson())`
methods:

[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        Represents a grumpy waiter that is too bored to sell any alcohol for anyone.
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/check"
        body(
            name: $(anyAlphaUnicode()),
            age: 25
            )
        }
        stubMatchers {
            jsonPath('$.age', byRegex('[2-9][0-9]'))
        }
        headers {
            contentType(applicationJson())
        }
    }
    response {
    }
}
----

Congratulations! You defined how you would like the contract for the request to look!

Now we can work on the response. In the `response` block, we want to define that the
status of our response will be 200. To do so, call `status 200`, as shown in the
following code:

[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        Represents a grumpy waiter that is too bored to sell any alcohol for anyone.
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/check"
        body(
            name: $(anyAlphaUnicode()),
            age: 25
            )
        }
        stubMatchers {
            jsonPath('$.age', byRegex('[2-9][0-9]'))
        }
        headers {
            contentType(applicationJson())
        }
    }
    response {
        status 200
    }
}
----

We want our response to have a body. We want to use the `message` and `status` fields.
In the `message`, we want to respond with `You're drunk [name from request]. Go home!`
For the `status`, we want to always return a `NOT_OK` value and have a custom assertion
in our tests.

Let's start with the `message` field. Spring Cloud Contract gives you a method, called
`fromRequest()`, that lets you specify in the response that you would like to fetch some
values from the request. In our case, the value we want in the request is inside the
request body under the `$.name` JSON path. Consequently, we can set the value of
`message` to `"You're drunk [${fromRequest().body('$.name')}]. Go home!",`. Note that we
have a `""` Groovy String with a `${}` String interpolation in which we're calling the
`fromRequest()` method. The following code shows how all of that works:

[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        Represents a grumpy waiter that is too bored to sell any alcohol for anyone.
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/check"
        body(
            name: $(anyAlphaUnicode()),
            age: 25
            )
        }
        stubMatchers {
            jsonPath('$.age', byRegex('[2-9][0-9]'))
        }
        headers {
            contentType(applicationJson())
        }
    }
    response {
        status 200
        body(
            message: "You're drunk [${fromRequest().body('$.name')}]. Go home!"
        )
    }
}
----

Now we have the message response that references the request. It's time for the second
field. Until now, we always provided a single value for the dynamic parts of the
contract. Whenever we have dynamic values on one side (consumer or producer), then we
must have a concrete value on the other side. In this case, we can provide that value
manually. For the response in the stub, we need to provide a concrete value equal to
`NOT_OK`. For the generated test, we want to have a custom assertion done via the
`assertStatus()` method defined in the base class. To achieve that, we need to write
`$(c("NOT_OK"), p(execute('assertStatus($it)')))`. Let's now analyze this syntax:

 * `c()` is a shortcut for `consumer()`, and `p()` is short for `producer(). By calling
 `$(c(),p())`, we provide a concrete value for the consumer and a dynamic one for the
 producer.
 * The `$(c("NOT_OK"),...)` means that, for the response in the stub, for the `status`
 field, we want the stub to contain a value of `NOT_OK`.
* The `$(...,p(execute('assertStatus($it)')))` means that we want, on the producer side,
in the autogenerated tests, to run a method defined in the base class. That method is
called `assertStatus()`. As a parameter of that method, we want to pass the value of
an element present in the response JSON. In our case, we provide a dynamic value for
the `$.status` field. `assertStatus($it)` gets translated to `assertStatus(read the
$.status from the response JSON)`

Now we can write the response body, as shown in the following code:

[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        Represents a grumpy waiter that is too bored to sell any alcohol for anyone.
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/check"
        body(
            name: $(anyAlphaUnicode()),
            age: 25
            )
        }
        stubMatchers {
            jsonPath('$.age', byRegex('[2-9][0-9]'))
        }
        headers {
            contentType(applicationJson())
        }
    }
    response {
        status 200
        body(
            message: "You're drunk [${fromRequest().body('$.name')}]. Go home!",
            status: $(c("NOT_OK"), p(execute('assertStatus($it)')))
        )
    }
}
----

Now we may want to perform some more complex analysis of the `message` field through a
method called `assertMessage()`. There's another way to do that: We can call the
`testMatchers` section.

Under `testMatchers`, we can define, through a JSON path, the element we want to
dynamically assert. To do so, we can add the following section:

[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        Represents a grumpy waiter that is too bored to sell any alcohol for anyone.
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/check"
        body(
            name: $(anyAlphaUnicode()),
            age: 25
            )
        }
        stubMatchers {
            jsonPath('$.age', byRegex('[2-9][0-9]'))
        }
        headers {
            contentType(applicationJson())
        }
    }
    response {
        status 200
        body(
            message: "You're drunk [${fromRequest().body('$.name')}]. Go home!",
            status: $(c("NOT_OK"), p(execute('assertStatus($it)')))
        )
        testMatchers {
            jsonPath('$.message', byCommand('assertMessage($it)'))
        }
    }
}
----

The last thing to add are the response headers. We do exactly the same thing as we
previously did for the request, except that we use
`headers { contentType(applicationJson()) }`, as shown in the following example:

[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        Represents a grumpy waiter that is too bored to sell any alcohol for anyone.
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/check"
        body(
            name: $(anyAlphaUnicode()),
            age: 25
            )
        }
        stubMatchers {
            jsonPath('$.age', byRegex('[2-9][0-9]'))
        }
        headers {
            contentType(applicationJson())
        }
    }
    response {
        status 200
        body(
            message: "You're drunk [${fromRequest().body('$.name')}]. Go home!",
            status: $(c("NOT_OK"), p(execute('assertStatus($it)')))
        )
        testMatchers {
            jsonPath('$.message', byCommand('assertMessage($it)'))
        }
        headers {
            contentType(applicationJson())
        }
    }
}
----

We're almost done. We wrote a very generic example that catches a person with any name.
However, in the requirements, we saw that a `starbuxman` person always has to get the
beer. Consequently, we need a specific case of our generic pattern. That is why we will
set the `priority` to `100` (the higher the number, the lower the priority).

[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        Represents a grumpy waiter that is too bored to sell any alcohol for anyone.
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/check"
        body(
            name: $(anyAlphaUnicode()),
            age: 25
            )
        }
        stubMatchers {
            jsonPath('$.age', byRegex('[2-9][0-9]'))
        }
        headers {
            contentType(applicationJson())
        }
    }
    response {
        status 200
        body(
            message: "You're drunk [${fromRequest().body('$.name')}]. Go home!",
            status: $(c("NOT_OK"), p(execute('assertStatus($it)')))
        )
        testMatchers {
            jsonPath('$.message', byCommand('assertMessage($it)'))
        }
        headers {
            contentType(applicationJson())
        }
    }
    priority 100
}
----

Congratulations! You have created your first contract! Now we can define a version for
someone named Josh.

. Copy the file and call it `shouldSellAlcoholOnlyToStarbuxman.groovy`.
. Set the name to `starbuxman`.
. Set the priority to `10`.
. Set the `message` to `There you go Josh!`.
. Set the `status` to `OK`.

NOTE: We do not want to do any custom server-side assertions.

[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        Represents a grumpy waiter that is too bored to sell any alcohol for anyone.
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/check"
        body(
            name: "starbuxman",
            age: 25
            )
        }
        stubMatchers {
            jsonPath('$.age', byRegex('[2-9][0-9]'))
        }
        headers {
            contentType(applicationJson())
        }
    }
    response {
        status 200
        body(
                message: "There you go Josh!",
                status: "OK"
        )
        headers {
            contentType(applicationJson())
        }
    }
    priority 10
}
----

Congratulations! You have created all the contracts. Now we can go ahead and install the
stubs, as shown in the following code for both Maven and Gradle:

[source,bash,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
----

[source,bash,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal
----

Now we can go back to our consumer tests and open the `GrumpyBartenderControllerTest`
class. We want to add Stub Runner as usual. However, this time, we do not pass the port.
We want the port to be set automatically.

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/consumer/src/test/java/com/example/GrumpyBartenderControllerTest.java[tags=stubrunner]
----

How can you retrieve the port value then? There are two ways of doing so:

* Autowire the field annotated with
`@Value("${stubrunner.runningstubs.artifactid.port}")`.
* Use the autowired `StubFinder` interface, which includes the `findStub` method.

The following code shows an example of autowiring the field for
`beer-api-producer-advanced`:

[source,java]
----
@Value("${stubrunner.runningstubs.beer-api-producer-advanced.port}") int stubPort;

@Before
public void setupPort() {
    controller.port = stubPort;
}
----

The following code shows an example of using the `StubFinder` interface for
`beer-api-producer-advanced`:

[source,java]
----
@Autowired StubFinder stubFinder;

@Before
public void setupPort() {
    controller.port = stubFinder.findStubUrl("beer-api-producer-advanced").getPort();
}
----

Let's go with the first option (autowiring the field). We want to inject the value of the
port of the running stub into the controller. Now, when we run the tests, then they
should pass successfully.

Congratulations! As consumers, we successfully used the API of the producer for both
HTTP and messaging. Now we can file a pull request (PR) to the producer's code with the
proposal of the contract. Let's switch to the producer side.

=== Producer Flow 1

include::snippets/producer_flow.adoc[]

include::snippets/generating_tests_from_contract.adoc[]

==== Fixing broken HTTP tests

The situation is that the generated tests have failed. We need to fix it by providing
the missing assert methods in the base class. We also need to
set up RestAssured. Let's start with the first one:

. Go to `BeerRestBase`.
. Add the missing `assertStatus(String status)` and `assertMessage(String message)`
methods (<<_missing_assert_methods,or copy from the solution>>).
* `assertStatus` should assert that the `status` is equal to `NOT_OK`.
* `assertMessage` should assert that the `message` contains `Go home!`
. Add the missing Rest Assured setup by adding the `BuyController` into the list of
standalone set up classes, as shown in the following code snippet:

[source,java]
----
RestAssuredMockMvc.standaloneSetup(..., new BuyController(), ...);
----
This time, we are not mocking in the base class, because we already did so in the
previous tutorials. Instead, we try to make our tests pass as fast as possible.

IMPORTANT: We want our Controller to use the async servlet functionality. That's
why we need it to return a `Callable<Response>`

To ensure that we return a `Callable<Response>`, we need to write our implementation of
the controller (<<_buycontroller,or copy from the solution>>) such that it has the
following characteristics:

* A POST method to the `/buy` endpoint that produces and consumes JSON
* If the `Person` name is equal to `starbuxman`, return a `status` code of `OK` and a
`message` of `There you go Josh`.
* If the `Person` name is not equal to `starbuxman`, return a `status` code of `NOT_OK`
and a `message` of `You're drunk [name]. Go home!`


Now, when you run the build again, your autogenerated tests still fail. The reason for
the failure is that we used the async servlet feature but Rest Assured does not know
that. To fix that, we need to add the `async()` method in the response side of our
contracts. (<<_grumpy_contracts,Check the solution>>). Now, when you run the build again,
your tests should pass.
