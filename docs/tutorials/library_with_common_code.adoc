= Library with common code {version}

In this tutorial we'll reuse the code created in the link::contracts_on_the_producer_side.html[contracts on the producer side].
We'll create a module in which we'll define some utility classes that can be reused in the contracts

Let us assume that there are multiple teams that would like to profit from the age related
regular expression that we have defined in the contract. Another piece of code that we would like
to share is the regular expression for response status (it makes little sense from the business
perspective but it's a tutorial ;) ).

== The common module

- Let's open the `common` project
- Under `src/main/java/com/example` you'll find 3 classes
    * `ConsumerUtils` - will contain some utility functions to be used on the `request` side of the
    contract
    * `PatternUtils` - will contain functions that can be used anywhere in the contract
    * `ProducerUtils` - will contain some utility functions to be used on the `response` side of the
    contract
- Let's write the missing implementations!
- Open the `PatternUtils` class
  * the `tooYoung` method needs to return the `"[0-1][0-9]"` String
  * the `oldEnough` method needs to return the compiled Pattern of a person whose
  age is greater or equal to 20. If you don't remember how to do it here is a small
  hint - `Pattern.compile("[2-9][0-9]")`
  * the `ok` method makes no business sense but we'll write it anyway ;) Let it
   return a compiled `Pattern` of `OK`. We just want to play around with the contract right?
   Just write - `Pattern.compile("OK")`
- Open the `ConsumerUtils` class
  * the `oldEnough` method returns `ClientDslProperty`. That's a type that the Spring Cloud Contract
  internals understand as those that need to be set appropriately for the `request` part of
   the contract.
+
TIP: Client == consumer == stub side in the nomenclature of Spring Cloud Contract
  * The `ClientDslProperty` either takes 2 arguments (or a single that gets copied to two fields)
    ** first one is the `client` value - the value that will be set to the stub on the request side.
    Can be a regular expression.
    ** second is the `server` value - the value that will be set in the request sent in the
    generated tests. MUST BE a concrete value
  * Let's create a new instance of `ClientDslProperty` where the `client` side will be
  the regular expression from `PatternUtils.oldEnough()` and the `server` value will e.g. `40`.
+
[source,java]
----
return new ClientDslProperty(PatternUtils.oldEnough(), 40);
----
- Open the `ProducerUtils`
  * the `ok` method returns `ServerDslProperty`. That's a type that the Spring Cloud Contract
  internals understand as those that need to be set appropriately for the `response` part of
   the contract.
+
TIP: Server == producer == test side in the nomenclature of Spring Cloud Contract
  * The `ServerDslProperty` either takes 2 arguments (or a single that gets copied to two fields)
    ** first one is the `server` value - the value that will be set to the generated test
    on the response side. Can be a regular expression.
    ** second is the `client` value - the value that will be set in the response sent in the
    stub. MUST BE a concrete value
  * Let's create a new instance of `ServerDslProperty` where the `server` side will be
  the regular expression from `PatternUtils.ok()` and the `server` value will e.g. `OK`.
+
[source,java]
----
return new ServerDslProperty(PatternUtils.ok(), "OK");
----

IMPORTANT: It is obvious that the examples are not the best from the point of view of
the business value but hopefully they'll allow you to get the idea of how to use the tool :)

- We have successfully implemented the utility classes.
- Now we have to build the project and install it locally
+
[source,bash,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
./mvnw clean install
----
+
[source,bash,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal
----
- Let's now try to use it!

== Using common classes on the producer side

- On the producer side, if we want the utility classes to be visible by the IDE we need to
add them as a test dependency to our project
+
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>beer-common</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----
+
[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
testCompile("com.example:beer-common:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT")
----
- Now our IDE should start seeing our functions. Let's modify the contracts to use them!
- Open the `shouldGrantABeerIfOldEnough.groovy` file and let's modify it (<<_modified_first_http_contract,or copy the solution>>)
  * make the `age` field in the request body have the value of `$(ConsumerUtils.oldEnough())`
  * make the `status` field in the response body have the value of `value(ProducerUtils.ok())`.
  (`value()` is the same as `$()` but you will be doing String interpolation via `${}` so having
  `${$()}` might seem bizarre so it's better to write `${value()}`
- Open the `shouldRejectABeerIfTooYoung.groovy` file and let's modify it (<<_modified_second_http_contract,or copy the solution>>)
  * make the `$.age` JSON path in the `stubMatchers` in the `byRegex` method get checked by
  `PatternUtils.tooYoung()` String pattern
- The contracts are updated! But we still need to update the build scripts.
- Adding the common JAR as a test dependency only helps us in the IDE. We need to make sure
that the plugins will also see that JAR. Let's add this dependency to the plugin's classpath
too.
+
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${spring-cloud-contract.version}</version>
    <extensions>true</extensions>
    <configuration>
        <!-- some existing configuration -->
    </configuration>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.example</groupId>
            <artifactId>beer-common</artifactId>
            <version>${project.version}</version>
            <scope>compile</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</plugin>
----
+
[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
buildscript {
	repositories {
		// some existing repositories
	}

	dependencies {
		// some existing plugins
		classpath "com.example:beer-common:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT"
	}
}
----
- Now if we run the build the contracts will successfully get converted to
 tests and JAR with stubs will get installed
+
[source,bash,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
./mvnw clean install
----
+
[source,bash,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal
----

== Using common classes on the consumer side

- Since the contracts get parsed at runtime of tests, we need to add the dependency
to the common utility JAR as a test dependency
+
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>beer-common</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----
+
[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
testCompile("com.example:beer-common:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT")
----
- And you're ready to run the tests as usual!
