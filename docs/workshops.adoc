= Spring Cloud Contract {version} Workshops

This documentation takes you through the Spring Cloud Contract Workshops by asking you to
complete a series of tasks that teach you both basic and more advanced concepts behind
Consumer Driven Contracts in general and Spring Cloud Contract in particular.

== Setup

The repository mostly consists of pairs of `producer` and `consumer` applications that
show different use cases of Spring Cloud Contract. The initial state of the repository
is such that all the examples are working and the tests are passing. In order for you to
prepare the repository so that it has only the basic pieces of code ready for use,
run the following Gradle command:

[source,groovy]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/spring-cloud-contract-samples
$ cd spring-cloud-contract-samples
$ ./gradlew prepareForWorkshops
----

The preceding commands removes most of the code, contracts, and project setup details, so
that you can start the workshops.

TIP: Whenever your lost, do not worry. At any time, you can check what the contents in
the `master` branch where all of the examples are ready and working.

IMPORTANT: You must have Maven installed. Check out
https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[the website on how to download and install Maven].

== Generating the documentation

To generate the documentation, call the Gradle task, as shown below:

[source,groovy]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/spring-cloud-contract-samples
$ cd spring-cloud-contract-samples
$ ./gradlew generateDocumentation
----
